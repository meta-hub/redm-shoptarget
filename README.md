# redm-shoptarget
Public repo containing some knowledge on shop shelf item targeting.  

### Note:  
This is by no means a recreation of RDR2 shop targetting, but it does contain some knowledge spread out amongst the CFX discord regarding this topic (mostly how to make the top shelf items targetable).  
Hopefully people will fork and update it, and create PR's in the future.
